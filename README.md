## Usage

Node.js, Yarn, and an InfluxDB database is needed. You will also need `localhost` web access to `vintage-influxdb` for OAuth authentication. There is still a way to deploy `vintage-influxdb` to a server, however you will need to clone this on your local machine first.

### Spotify Setup

1. Create a Spotify application on the [Devloper Dashboard page](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2. Once you have created your application, go to the info page for your application where the graphs are, then click on "Edit Settings".
3. Add the redirect URI: `http://localhost:4629/callback`. You may optionally change the redirect port. Save the settings. You will need to refer to this page again for the client ID and secret.

### InfluxDB Setup

1. Go to your InfluxDB web UI and head over to the "Data" tab on the sidebar.
2. Go the "Buckets" tab and create a bucket.
3. Head over to the "Tokens" tab and generate a read/write token. Give the token write access to the bucket you just created.
4. Lastly go to the "Sources" tab and click on "Javascript/Node.js" under "Client Libraries". Select the appropriate token and bucket. Under "Initialize the Client" you will see the info you need for `vintage-influxdb`.

### vintage-influxdb setup

1. Clone this repository and use `yarn` to install dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/kyleawayan/vintage-influxdb
cd vintage-influxdb
yarn install
```

2. Edit the `config.example.json` file and fill in the values. For the `spotify_clientId:Secret` variable, it is formatted like this: `<client_id>:<client_secret>`. The variable `influxDbHostName` is just a name for the host that is sending the data (you can name it anything you want).
3. Rename the `config.example.json` file to `config.json`.
4. Start `vintage-influxdb`.

```
yarn start
```

5. Click the link that was console logged. If you see `Starting to record data...`, you're done! You can make sure it is working by playing and skipping around tracks on Spotify. It will console log some information and write data to the database about the track when it is finished playing, skipped, or paused.

There is a bug where sometimes the token won't refresh correctly, and `vintage-influxdb` will just freeze. A temporary fix is to [restart `vintage-influxdb` daily](https://github.com/kyleawayan/vintage-influxdb/issues/1).

There are dashboard templates for InfluxDB and Grafana that I have made in the `templates` folder.

### Deploying on a server

If you would like to host this on a server, you will need to move your `config.json` and `spotifyKeys.json` files from your local machine to the server. Just `git clone` this repo on your server and copy those two files over. You can also use `pm2` to run it in the background and start on boot:

```
cd vintage-influxdb
pm2 start yarn --name vintage-influxdb -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

## Developing

```
yarn dev
```

This will auto-compile on file changes using `ts-node-dev`. **Make sure to use another InfluxDB database or bucket for development!**
